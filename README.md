### GERDA project

With Vincent Heddesheimer, Andreas Wiedemann, and Florian Sichart, we collected data on German election results at the local level for various types of elections.

- Main GitHub repo: <https://github.com/awiedem/german_election_data>
- R package to access the data: <https://github.com/hhilbig/gerda>

### Other data sets

- Municipality-level panel on broadband coverage in Germany (2005â€“2021), using 2021 borders. Due to limited documentation and provider changes in 2015, data may not be fully accurate or comparable over time. <https://github.com/hhilbig/broadband>
